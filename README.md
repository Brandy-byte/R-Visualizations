# R-Visualizations
All my R projects and the visualizations generated from data are showcased here. This repository serves as a gallery of my work, ranging from beginner-level practice projects to more advanced analyses, including lab and internship work. Each project demonstrates the skills in data visualization, analysis, and R programming I can deliver to clients.
