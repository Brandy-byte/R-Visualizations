# R-Visualizations
R Data Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my R Data Visualization Portfolio! This repository showcases my work in R, including data visualization, analysis, and basic preprocessing. It serves as a portfolio of my skills for freelance clients, demonstrating my ability to turn datasets into clear, professional, and visually appealing results. Projects range from beginner-level practice to more advanced analyses completed during lab work and my internship. This is a growing portfolio, and I will be adding more R visualizations and projects regularly to showcase my ongoing work and skill development.

Projects:
1. Practice Visualizations:
Description: Simple practice projects using sample datasets.
Tools: ggplot2
Examples: Histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts

2. Lab Work:
Description: Projects completed while assisting in a research lab.
Tools: ggplot2, base R
Examples: Basic data analyses and visualizations for research datasets

3. Internship Project â€“ UCLA Bearden Lab: Cortical Thickness Visualization:
Description: Analyzed cortical thickness data and created visualizations using ggseg.
Tools: ggseg, ggplot2, R
Notes: Complex visualizations created with guidance; demonstrates ability to handle specialized datasets

How to Use:
Open the .R scripts in RStudio.
Run scripts line by line to generate visualizations.
Sample datasets are included where necessary.
